    ### üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Used:
    
    For this analysis, we are querying the `calendar.csv` dataset, stored in Snowflake due to its astronomical size. Each row of the data represents the airbnb price for each day each each listing on airbnb for the past year.
    
    The `calendar.csv` dataset contains the following columns (data head shown below): 
    
    | listing_id | date      | available | price   | adjusted_price | minimum_nights | maximum_nights |
    |------------|-----------|-----------|---------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
    | 2384       | 9/12/2023 | f         | $125.00 | $125.00        | 3              | 1125           |
    | 2384       | 9/13/2023 | f         | $125.00 | $125.00        | 3              | 1125           |
